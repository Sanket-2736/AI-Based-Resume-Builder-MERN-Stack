# AI Resume Builder (MERN)

**AI Resume Builder** is a web application to design and preview resumes using a React (Vite) frontend and a typical MERN backend. This repository contains the `client` (React + Vite + Tailwind) portion of the app.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

Install and run the frontend:

```bash
# from repository root
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

If the project has a backend (e.g., `server/` folder), install dependencies and start it similarly (check the server README or package.json for exact commands).

## 🧩 What’s Included

- client/: React + Vite application
  - src/
    - assets/
      - templates/ (resume templates)
    - components/ (reusable UI sections)
    - pages/ (app pages like Home, Dashboard, ResumeBuilder, Preview)

Key pages:
- `Home` — marketing / landing
- `ResumeBuilder` — build/edit resume content
- `Preview` — preview generated resume template
- `Dashboard` — saved resumes / account area

---

## 🛠️ Frontend Scripts (client)

All frontend scripts live in `client/package.json`.

- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — build production bundle
- `npm run preview` — locally preview the production build
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint checks

Dependencies include React 19, React Router, Tailwind, Axios, and Vite.

## 💡 Development Notes & Tips

- Tailwind and Vite are configured in the client; change styles via `src/index.css` and Tailwind config if present.
- Templates are in `src/assets/templates` — use them as examples to add more resume layouts.
- Keep routes and page components in `src/pages` to follow the project structure.

Environment variables:
- If your frontend talks to a backend, use an `.env` file in `client/` and reference variables (e.g. `VITE_API_URL`) in the code.
